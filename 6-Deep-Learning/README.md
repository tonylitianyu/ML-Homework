# HW6: Neural Networks for CS349 @ NU
**IMPORTANT: PUT YOUR NETID IN THE FILE** `netid` in the root directory of the assignment. 
This is used to put the autograder output into Canvas. Please don't put someone else's netid 
here, we will check.


In this assignment, you will:
- Learn how to use PyTorch
- Implement two types of neural networks
- Explore the impact of different hyperparameters on your networks' performance


## Jupyter Notebook

We have created a jupyter notebook which you can use that should guide you through the complete homework. We heavily recommend using it, since most Deep Learning research is now done within Jupyter Notebooks. You find the notebook here:

experiments/deep-learning-experiments.ipynb

## Environment setup

Make a conda environment for this assignment, and then run:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

**IMPORTANT: PyTorch is not included in `requirements.txt`!** To install PyTorch, find the correct install command for your operating system and version of python [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For "PyTorch Build" select the `Stable (1.1)` build, select your operating system, for "Package" select `pip` , for "Language" select your python version (either python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7), and finally for "CUDA" select `None`. **Make sure to run the command with your conda environment activated.**
